# Rural-Covid-Care
NEURALHACK 2020
## What it does
It predicts the disease and provides suggestion for medicines based on the symptoms entered.
It provides credit insurance in case of someone's death based on parameters like bmi, number of children etc.
Implemented a dashboard to store all the health details of a person.
Also build a Social Distance Detector to maintain social distancing to avoid spread of disease in public places.
## How we built it
For Disease prediction and Insurance Premium we used RandomForestClassifier to train our DataSet.
For Social Distancing we used yolov3 algorithm to train our model as it is the best algo for real time application.
Then we deployed our Model in backend using flask.
For frontend we used html and css.
## Challenges we ran into
Integration of all the components.
Testing and Training our Model to get High Accuracy.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Developed a System which can solve Rural problems.
